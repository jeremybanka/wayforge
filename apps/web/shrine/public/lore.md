Player/Character Archetypes

Field Guide to Player/Characters:

What does it look like to be authentically attached to this game?

Example, players who enjoy the game as a social environment, but aren’t serious about the game. They are more likely borrowing cards than to have their own cards. They have fun and get frustrated, or get bored. They do not try to pretend to fit into the world, typically only addressing other players to ask what they can do to help, or what is possible to do in general.

We can call these players “tourists”. They are among the easiest Player/Characters to spot.

We need a constant rotation of “tourists” in the cast. Some people are serial tourists, and some are considering buying into the world

- We need two or three example tourists of varied ages
- The main character's older brother and sister who are now in serial tourist mode. Their cards are rare and sort of illegal now. Played when they were younger, and now their kid cousin is into it, so they play with him and his friends.
- We need an example of a player who is considering buying into the world to impress his recent acquaintance, but is not sure if he wants to commit to the game.
- Younger brother wants to play but doesn't know how!

Some players make it their mission to "restore justice" to the game.

We call these "acolytes". They are aided by and foresworn to a sort of "Avenging Angel", Also bizarrely known by the name "Master Chess", this crafty being claims to be the creator of the game, and is the only one who can make new cards. The acolytes are not allowed to make new cards without the permission of the Avenging Angel.

- We need a small band of hearty warriors: sun cleric, gravity guy, and hooded laser sniper. They should have a luminescent yellow quality and wield sun themed magic collectively.
