## useO

`useO` is a React hook that allows you to observe reactive variables in your React components.

<UseO client:load />

## useI

`useI` is a React hook that allows you to update reactive variables in your React components.

<UseI client:load />

## useJSON

`useJSON` is a React hook that makes working with mutable atoms in your react components more convenient.

<UseJSON client:load />

## useTL

`useTL` provides convenient access to the `undo` and `redo` utilities, as well as metadata representing how many events are on the timeline (`length`) and where the timeline is currently positioned (`at`).

<UseTL client:load />

## useLoadable

If you have a `Loadable` atom or selector, `useLoadable` is a great way to observe it in your React components.

<UseLoadable client:load />

In this example, we can see that the hook will return the string `"LOADING"` until the promise resolves. Then, it will return an object containing `value` with our data, and `loading` indicating whether new data is on its way.

<UseLoadableFallback client:load />

If you'd rather assume your data is loaded, simply pass a fallback parameter with same type as your loaded data.

In this case, you don't have to deal with the possibility that your data is `"LOADING"`, and you'll also get a separate `error` property if the promise rejects.
