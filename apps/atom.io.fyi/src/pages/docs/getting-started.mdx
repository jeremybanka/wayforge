# getting started

Let's make an app with `atom.io`.

We'll use `node` and `pnpm` for this guide, so make sure you have those installed.

- node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- pnpm: https://pnpm.io/installation

set up a new project

```sh
mkdir my-atom-io-app
cd my-atom-io-app
pnpm init -y
pnpm add vite react react-dom atom.io
pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```
