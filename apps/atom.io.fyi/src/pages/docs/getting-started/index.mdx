# getting started

This is a guide to getting started with `atom.io`.

We'll use `node` and `pnpm` for this guide, so make sure you have those installed.

- node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- pnpm: https://pnpm.io/installation

## install

```sh
pnpm create vite-react-app my-atom-io-app
cd my-atom-io-app
```

## install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install vite react react-dom atom.io
```
