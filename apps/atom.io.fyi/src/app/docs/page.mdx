# atom.io

## overview

`atom.io` is a data management library for TypeScript with the following goals:

1. Laziness: only recompute values that are being observed, whose dependencies have changed
2. Testability: write unit tests for your store without mocking
3. Portability: run your store in the browser, on the server, or in a web worker
4. Batteries Included: solve common use cases like transactions and time travel
5. Composability: build your store out of small, reusable pieces. Declare them anywhere, import them where you need them, and organize later

## atom

import DeclareAnAtom from "x/core/atom/declare-an-atom.gen"
import AnAtomTokenIsAReference from "x/core/atom/an-atom-token-is-a-reference.gen"
import GetAndSetAnAtom from "x/core/atom/get-and-set-an-atom.gen"
import SubscribeToAnAtom from "x/core/atom/subscribe-to-an-atom.gen"
import SubscribePowersIntegrations from "x/core/atom/subscribe-is-the-foundation-of-reactivity.gen"

<DeclareAnAtom />
Imagine an `atom` as a "reactive variable," with a key, a type, and a default value.

<AnAtomTokenIsAReference />
As you can see, what is returned from `atom` does not contain the value itself.

Instead, it returns an importable, serializable, and replaceable reference to the value.

We call this an `AtomToken`. In this case, an `AtomToken<number>`.

<GetAndSetAnAtom />
An atom's value is accessed by calling `getState` and `setState` with the atom's token.

TypeScript will discourage you from setting the wrong type of value.

<SubscribeToAnAtom />
Unlike a standard variable, you can `subscribe` to an atom. The callback you pass
to the subscription will be called whenever the atom is set to a new value.

<SubscribePowersIntegrations />
This is an example of the **observer pattern**. Following the observer pattern allows
atom.io to easily integrate with an observer like React. More on this later.

## selector

import DeclareASelector from "x/core/selector/declare-a-selector.gen"
import UseASelector from "x/core/selector/use-a-selector.gen"

<DeclareASelector />

A selector is also a reactive variable, but its value is derived from other atoms or selectors.

<UseASelector />

In this example, we can see that by setting `dividendState` to a new value, the value of `quotientState` is automatically updated.

## families

import DeclareAFamily from "x/core/families/declare-a-family.gen"
import UseAnIndexToTrackFamilyMembers from "x/core/families/use-an-index-to-track-family-members.gen"

Sometimes you need a lot of the same type of atom or selector. The `atomFamily` and `selectorFamily` functions provide a convenient interface for declaring states dynamically.

<DeclareAFamily />

For example, maybe we're making an app with `Point`s laid out in two dimensions.

We might use an `atomFamily` to handle creating state for each node. Or, better yet, we might make two familiesâ€”for each node's x and y coordinates.

Counterintuitively, it is likely a performance win in highly interactive applications to take the latter approach, because when nodes move, we only need to replace two primitives in the underlying map, rather than a whole object.

This is the key to high-performance interactivity in atom.io: **the smaller the state, the better**.

If you want to update your states frequently, keep state primitive.

<UseAnIndexToTrackFamilyMembers />

In this example, we use a single `atom<string[]>` to track the members of our family.

It is up to you to decide how to track the members of families you create. `atom.io` does not do this, because different sorts of collections have different performance characteristics. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

Keen readers may recognize that collections generally extend `Object`, and that `Object` is **not** primitive. If you use a lot of collections in your store, or your collections change frequently, you may consider using `mutable` atoms for them. More on this in the advanced section.

## transaction

import CallAFamilyInATransaction from "x/core/transaction/call-a-family-in-a-transaction.gen"
import IterateThroughAnIndexChangingTheValueOfSomeAtoms from "x/core/transaction/iterate-through-an-index-changing-the-value-of-some-atoms.gen"
import TryCatchAFailedTransaction from "x/core/transaction/try-catch-a-failed-transaction.gen"

Transactions allow you to batch multiple atom changes into a single update. This is useful for validating a complex set of changes before it is applied to the store.

<CallAFamilyInATransaction />

A common use case is creating some new state using a family function and adding it to an index tracking members of that family.

<IterateThroughAnIndexChangingTheValueOfSomeAtoms />

In this example, we add a minute to all running timers.

<TryCatchAFailedTransaction />

If a transaction throws, the state of the store is not changed. However, it is up to you to handle the error.

## timeline

import CreateATimeline from "x/core/timeline/create-a-timeline.gen"
import SubscribeToATimeline from "x/core/timeline/subscribe-to-a-timeline.gen"
import UndoAndRedoChanges from "x/core/timeline/undo-and-redo-changes.gen"

Timelines allow you to track the history of a group of atoms. If these atoms are set, or set as a group by a selector or transaction, the timeline will record the changes. A timeline can be used to undo and redo changes.

<CreateATimeline />

In this example, we create a timeline that tracks the history of two families of atoms.

<SubscribeToATimeline />

In this example, we subscribe to the timeline. Above are the structures of timeline updates.

<UndoAndRedoChanges />

In this example, we undo and redo changes to the timeline.

## advanced

### async

import AwaitYourState from "x/core/advanced/async/await-your-state.gen"
import LoadableSelector from "x/core/advanced/async/loadable-selector.gen"
import AvoidRaceBetweenPromises from "x/core/advanced/async/avoid-race-between-promises.gen"

Often, state is not immediately available. For example, if you are fetching data from a server, you might use the fetch function `atom.io` offers natural support for `Promise` and `async/await` patterns.

<AwaitYourState />

`Loadable` is a shorthand that means "sometimes this is a `Promise`". This is really useful, because `await` is harmless if the value is not a Promise. When the Promise does resolve, the value is set into the value map, allowing for maximum versatility in Suspenseful environments.

<LoadableSelector />

Here is an example where get a query parameter from the URL, then use it to fetch some data from a server. This is a great pattern, because our selector's value will be cached as long as the URL parameter does not change.

<AvoidRaceBetweenPromises />

In the case that we update an async state more quickly than the promises are resolved, only the last promise's resolved value will be set into the state. All previous results will be discarded.

{/* ### mutable */}

{/* By default, `atom.io` assumes that the values of atoms are immutable data, always to be copied when changed. However, this constant copying can lead to poor performance, and in particular, a lot of work for your engine's garbage collector. Mutable atoms provide a path to optimization through less garbage creation. */}
