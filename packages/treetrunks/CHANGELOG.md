### Patch Changes

- 9e9afe4: ✨ Add the new `ReduceTree` type which applies `MergeTree` over a tuple of trees.
- 9e9afe4: ✨ Add new types `ExhaustiveTreeMap` and `ExhaustiveTreePath` which include 'partway' paths which wouldn't be valid in terms of 'required/optional' terms, but which may still be useful when analyzing the structure of a `Tree`.
- 9e9afe4: ✨ Add the new `MergeTree` type, which neatly merges the structures of two different trees. Any path valid in one of the two trees `(A B)` given to `MergeTree<A, B>` is valid in the resulting tree.
- 9e9afe4: ♻️ Refactored `isTreePath`, bringing treetrunks' code coverage to 100%.
