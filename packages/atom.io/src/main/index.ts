/**
 * Loadable is used to type atoms or selectors that may at some point be initialized to or set to a {@link Promise}.
 *
 * When a Promise is cached as the value of a state in atom.io, that state will be automatically set to the resolved value of the Promise when it is resolved.
 *
 * As a result, we consider any state that can be a set to a Promise to be a "loadable" state, whose value may or may not be a Promise at any given time.
