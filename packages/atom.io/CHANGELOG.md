# atom.io

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 4aa5896: ✨ `subscribeToTimeline` allows you to see all updates that occur on a timeline.
- 4aa5896: ✨ Realtime hooks are now available as direct imports, e.g., `import { usePull } from "atom.io/realtime"`.
- 4aa5896: ✨ `silo` and `__INTERNAL__.createStore` now accept an optional `Store` parameter that will be copied to the new store.
- 4aa5896: 🎁 Package `atom.io/realtime-react` is now properly exported (previously internal as `atom.io/realtime-client`).
- 4aa5896: ✨ `TimelineUpdate`s now include a `timestamp` when the update first began processing.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 16ab1792: ✨ `import { silo } from "atom.io"` is our newest core function. Calling `silo("storeName")` returns an isolated instance of the core atom.io features, which can be very useful for testing libraries that synchronize multiple store instances.
- 87b85031: 🎁 New Subpackage! `atom.io/realtime` is a `socket.io`-powered system for exposing state from your node server to any client running atom.io and socket.io-client.

### Patch Changes

- 87b85031: 🏷️ Improve typings for tokens to include a `__brand?: T` property, where `T` is the type that the token refers to. This is helpful in unions, where a union including tokens of several types would otherwise lose their typing information. Important to note that the brand property is _never there._ It's a fiction, used to improve type inference, which isn't well-supported for discard types.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- ebfc6b7: 🏷️ New Type: `TransactionIO<TransactionToken>` infers the Params and ReturnType from the internal implementation of an AtomIO transaction.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5d689: 🎉 New sub-package: `import { AtomIODevtools } from "atom.io/devtools"`. This is a component that shows you the state of every atom in your app, and allows you to change any atom whose value extends Json.
- ba5d689: ✨ For your convenience, `useStore`, `useI`, `useO` and `useIO` can be imported directly from `atom.io/react`
- ba5d689: 💥 BREAKING CHANGE: `useStore` is no longer returned from `composeStoreHooks`

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 75b0edc: 🏷️ `Read<ƒ>` and `Write<ƒ>` types for selectors and transactions
- 90cca7f: 🥅 nested calls to `setState` are no longer performed and an error is logged
- 90cca7f: 🐛 `timeline` now properly erases the future when a change is made in the past
- 90cca7f: 🐛 setting a `selector` no longer results in multiple timeline events
- 90cca7f: 🥅 an `atom` or `atomFamily` can no longer be tracked by multiple timelines. instead they must belong to only one.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fe9fe8d: 💥 simplify API for `atom`, `selector`, related families and `transaction`
- fe9fe8d: ✨ `useLogger` and `setLogLevel` allow custom logging configuration for atom.io
- 30865e7: ✨ `timeline` tracks atoms over time. navigate it with the new `undo` and `redo` functions
- 9b9c775: ✨ `subscribeToTransaction` accepts a `TransactionToken` and a function that will be called with each `TransactionUpdate`
- fe9fe8d: ✨ export `Serializable` type used for keys in families
- 30865e7: ✨ `runTransaction` accepts a `TransactionToken` and returns the function signature of the transaction.
- 9b9c775: ✨ `AtomFamily`, `SelectorFamily`, and `ReadonlySelectorFamily` functions include a `key`, a `type`, and (at least for now) an exposed `Rx.Subject`. this subject emits newly minted `AtomToken`s, `SelectorToken`s, and `ReadonlyValueToken`s, respectively.
- fe9fe8d: ✨ `AtomToken`, `SelectorToken`, and `ReadonlyValueToken` include family metadata if they were created by a family function

### Patch Changes

- fe9fe8d: 🚀 effect in `useStore` now only runs onMount
- 30865e7: ♻️ `transaction`s do not emit changes until they succeed
- fe9fe8d: 🐛 `selector` no longer throws, but logs error when run with a living key

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 86dc905: ✨ `atom.io/react` module: `composeStoreHooks` ✨ `useI` `useO` `useIO`
- 5f86821: 🚀 major performance improvement: selectors no longer eagerly evaluate by default
- d3ebb42: ✨ give your `atom<T>` a function `() => T` as its `default` value
- 86dc905: 💥 `atom.io/react` module: `composeStoreHook` ➡️ `composeStoreHooks`
- d3ebb42: ✨ `isDefault` can be used to know whether state has been set before
- 86dc905: ✨ support for preact

### Patch Changes
