# rel8

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 23eeda27: ‚ú® Pass a custom `makeContentKey` function into your `Junction`'s second constructor param, `JunctionAdvancedConfiguration`.
- 3654af64: ‚ú® `rel8/junction`: Add new `externalStore` API. By passing this option in the `JunctionAdvancedConfig`, you can force the Junction to read and write data from some other source, instead of keeping its own encapsulated state. This is useful when working with a global store that isolates pieces of state to manage dispatching renders, since you can manage the separation of relations yourself.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- ce3acb1: üîß Fix package configuration so that the entrypoint is properly identified.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- ac2744f: üè∑Ô∏è The type of a `Junction`'s `<Content>` type parameter now defaults to null unless directly passed, or inferred from a `Refinement` function passed to the `Junction` constructor.
- ac2744f: üí• Exports previously from `rel8/types` now come from `rel8`
- ac2744f: üè∑Ô∏è Expose some helpful utility types from `rel8/junction`, including types to explicitly differentiate between the semi-optional `JunctionConfig` passed to the constructor and the `JunctionJSON` returned from the `Junction.toJSON()` method.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a8efdaf5: üè∑Ô∏è Compatibility with tsconfig's "exactOptionalPropertyTypes" compiler option.
- a8efdaf5: ‚ú® The `Junction<ASide, BSide, Content>` class now includes `Content` as its third generic Parameter. `Content` must be a JSON object only (at least for now) but can be used to make your Junction expect new relations to include Content of a certain type.
- a8efdaf5: üéÅ New submodule: `rel8/types`! Provides typings used among `rel8`'s other submodules.
- a8efdaf5: ‚ú® `Junction.cardinality` is now applied when setting relations.
