- [x] atoms and selectors
- [x] implicit store
- [x] readonly selectors
- [x] settable selectors
- [x] safe recursive update propagation
- [x] safely expose atoms and selectors
- [x] give atoms and selectors separate types with a common base
- [x] utility function to pass logger to your store
- [x] selector memoization
- [x] atom and selector families
- [ ] atom effects
- [ ] transactions
- [ ] atom default as function
- [ ] atom default as promise
- [ ] resettable atoms
- [ ] resettable selectors
- [ ] refactor selector dependencies to be asymmetrical
      this would mean rebuilding the dependency graph on every update
      but it would allow for more efficient selector memoization
- [ ] trampoline for recursive propagation
- [ ] optional default value for atoms
- [ ] optional state keys
