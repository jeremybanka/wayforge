"atom.io": patch
---

🎁 `atom.io/eslint-plugin` is a new subpackage providing useful guidance against possible non-obvious pitfalls that may arise for developers. Currently, only one rule is included: `synchronous-selector-dependencies`, which should help prevent the states that selectors depend on from being gathered at arbitrary times. Documentation forthcoming on https://atom.io.fyi.
