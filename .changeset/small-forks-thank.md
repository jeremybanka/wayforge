ðŸ’¥ BREAKING CHANGE: Recoil submodules (`hamr/recoil-tools`, `hamr/recoil-error-boundary`, `hamr-recoil-effect-storage`) have been removed. `hamr/atom.io-tools` added to replace `hamr/recoil-tools`. With the abandonment of recoil and its incompatibility with React 19 internals, advise moving all recoil code to atom.io.
