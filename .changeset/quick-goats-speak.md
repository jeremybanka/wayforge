"atom.io": patch
---

ðŸš€ Thanks to the new `atom.io/internal` `LazyMap`, `transaction` should see better performance when working in larger stores. Before this update, initializing (or "building") a transaction would copy the entire valueMap, atoms map, selectors map, etc. all at once, incurring a lot of immediate overhead. Now, the `LazyMap` will only copy the values that are actually modified, when they are modified.
