"atom.io": patch
---

✨ `atom.io/eslint-plugin` Added a new rule, `naming-convention`. This rule enforces that any `atom`, `atomFamily`, `mutableAtom`, `mutableAtomFamily`, `selector`, or `selectorFamily` variable name end with -Atom, -Selector, etc. respectively. It also enforces that the `key` property given in these declarations match the variable name provided.
