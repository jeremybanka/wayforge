üè∑Ô∏è Improve typings for tokens to include a `__brand?: T` property, where `T` is the type that the token refers to. This is helpful in unions, where a union including tokens of several types would otherwise lose their typing information. Important to note that the brand property is _never there._ It's a fiction, used to improve type inference, which isn't well-supported for discard types.
